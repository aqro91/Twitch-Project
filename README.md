I quickly analyze the information from Twitch, this information contains more than 800,000 rows
Twitch is the worldâ€™s leading video platform and community where millions of people and thousands of
interests collide in a beautiful explosion of video games, pop culture, and conversation. 
Its live and on-demand video platform forms the backbone of a distribution network for video game broadcasters 
including professional players, tournaments, leagues, developers and gaming media organizations.
